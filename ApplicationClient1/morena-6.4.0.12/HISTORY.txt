Version 4.1 4.4.2001
1) Bug fix: exception cleaning before next scan production
2) Bug fix: JavaTwain does not use setProperties method in ImageProducer calling. That's why it used to call setProperties(null). We stopped it. For now, it does not call any setProperties method.

1) New remote scanning examples included in the full version release. (client/server design, applet design).
2) We received information, that in some environments Twain dialog windows popped up behind the other windows and are not visible. There is Example5.java in the examples directory, which demonstrates how to solve the situation.
3) Bug fix: setFrame() has real number arguments. It sent to the Twain driver integer values only. It is fixed, now.
4) Bug fix: If selectSource() threw an exception, it did not close the source. It close it correctly, now.
