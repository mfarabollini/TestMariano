MorenaCapabilities directory contains MorenaCapabilities library with an example how to use this library.


MorenaCapabilities library allows these features:

-	Pops up pure Java user interface windows to allow users to set the required scanning capabilities (options in Sane).
-	It remembers the last used interface (Twain/Sane), last used hardware, last used capabilities and their values. This
 is the often required "One button scanning" solution.
